# node-scripts-zsh
An (oh-my-zsh)[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh] plugin that helps you to autocomplete npm scripts that are present in your pwd!

This is still just starting out but it might be big someday like ESLint. That's my goal at least.

## Goals:
* Cross-platform for:
    * Windows
    * MacOS
    * Linux

* Simple and automatic

* Smart enough to check for 
    * node_modules
    * package.json
    * current pwd
